大家都知道Cheat Engine 是啥吧？（一下简称CE）

如果你不知道..

咳咳..

你估计应该可以跳过这篇文章了.. xD


## Cheat Engine 是啥？

如果你真的真的不知道，或者你已经知道了，也就读读看吧

>Cheat Engine is an open source tool designed to help you with modifying single player games running under window so you can make them harder or easier depending on your preference(e.g: Find that 100hp is too easy, try playing a game with a max of 1 HP), but also contains other usefull tools to help debugging games and even normal applications.

>It comes with a memory scanner to quickly scan for variables used within a game and allow you to change them, but it also comes with a debugger, disassembler, assembler, speedhack, trainer maker, direct 3D manipulation tools, system inspection tools and more.

>For new users it is recommended to go through the **tutorial**(The one that comes with Cheat Engine, you can find it in your programs list after installing) and at least reach step 5 for basic understanding of the usage of Cheat Engine

>If you need help on Cheat Engine , you can always contact me at dark_byte@hotmail.com , msn supported as well(don't ask about online games, I don't know anything about that)
Or on irc: server: irc.p2p-network.net channel: #cef (Web-based irc)

>Note: It will most likely not work on online games, so don't bother asking me that
Local Cheat Engine WIKI

>Note that since cheat engine is open source, everyone is welcome to contribute to the project. Contact dark_byte@hotmail.com for more information about helping.

不翻译了哈 xD

## Cheat Engine Tutorial?

看到那个第三个quote我**bold**起来的Tutorial 字样么？

你表示：神马？Cheat Engine 有自带的Tutorial？

我表示：有！

我第一次看到那个CE Tutorial的时候是N年前，不小心开到的..（不过当时没兴趣玩.__.）

好吧，那东就在这里：Help > Cheat Engine Tutorial

**现在我运行的CE是版本6.4 教程版本3.2**

## Step 1

>Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial. (v3.2)

>This tutorial will try to explain the basics of cheating on games, and getting you more familiar with Cheat Engine.

>First open Cheat Engine if it hasn't been opened yet.
Then click on the 'open process' icon. (top left icon, with the computer on it)

>When the process window is open find this tutorial. The process name is probably 'tutorial.exe' unless yourenamed it.
Select it, and click ok. Just ignore all the other buttons right now, but experiment with them later if you feel like it.

>When everything went right, the process window should be gone now and at the top of CE the processname isshown.

>Now, click NEXT to continue to the next step. (Or fill in the password to proceed to that particular step you want)

很简单罢了

在使用CE之前

你必须得要有一个目标

在这里呢，就是一个个**Process** 也就是进程

简单来说

打开Windows Task Manager

看到那个Processes的tab了么

恩

点进去

那一堆就是Processes（进程们）

>你表示：我不是新手了... 可以不要解释那么多么...

>我表示： 不 xD 罗嗦点好 娃哈哈
